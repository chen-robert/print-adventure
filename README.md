# *README*

## A. Overview

A procedurally-generated text-based RPG with save files! Also, written
in Python. I'm doing this project because it's fun! And also because
I want to get more experience using Python (which is why I'm not
writing it in C++, my language of choice).

## B. Acknowledgments

Acknowledgments will be added here as the project goes on.

Thanks to everyone who has played a part in my computer science
education so far! And many thanks to my terrific girlfriend for
listening to me talk about CS all the time. <3

## C. Files

Here is a brief overview of every file in the project.

    Contains the definition of the Player class.
    
  zone.py
